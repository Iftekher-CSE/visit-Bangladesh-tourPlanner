        "answer": "ReactJS creates different Elements by using JSX. JSX is JS syntax extension embed with HTML codes. Elements creates a copy of actual DOM called as Virtual-DOM. If any data changes React immediately creates Virtual-DOM instead of changing actual DOM. When a new Virtual-DOM is created it find the difference between previous Virtual-DOM and new Virtual-DOM by using Diff-algorithm. And finally ReactJS update that specific part in the actual DOM."

        "question": "Difference between state and props",
        "id": "q02",
        "answer": "1. Props are used to sent data from one component to other. we can sent variable, function, array, object etc. as props from parent to child component. State can update data within the component.\n 2. Props are read-only, you cannot update the value. One can update and modify state. \n 3.Props are immutable. State is mutable.\n 4.Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component. The State is internal and controlled by the React Component itself."
